# Android based Home Automation Using Firebase

The main objective of this project is to develop a home automation system using NodeMCU being remotely controlled by any smart phone.
Remote controlled home automation system provides a most modern solution with smart phones. In order to achieve this, we use a NodeMCU which is connected with 5V supply and at the output terminal of NodeMCU, a 5v 4 channel relay module is used which acts as a switch and with the help of NodeMCU we can remotely control the output of relay module by just one click in our mobile app.
